What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used? GET requests data from a specified resource while POST submits data to be processed to a specified resource. GET is used when forms involve database queries only, while POST is used when you update databases.
Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests? Cookies are data as small text files on your computer. They basically are a marker that remembers information about the user after the connection to the server ends. For HTTP, a cookie can be stored in the user's web browser so that the website can remember information for the next HTTP request.
