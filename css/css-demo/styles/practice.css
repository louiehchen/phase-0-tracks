/* Cascading means that styles can fall from one style sheet to another, meaning you can use multiple 
stylesheets in one html page. When conflicts occur, CSS determines which to use by a number of factors including 
source order, specificity, and number of selectors involved. "Weight" can also overrule other rules of inheritance.
