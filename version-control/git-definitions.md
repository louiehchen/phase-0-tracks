# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is when you keep different versions of a software system organized. It's useful because you can track different progress points throughout your process. It's like savepoints in a videogame.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches are movable pointers to different commits. They let you move around to scenarios your project can take. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is the act of making a change permanent. You often want to include a commit message as a comment on what you actually changed from the previous iteration of the file or program. 
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when there is an issue merging branches. A common example is when two different entities are changing the same file.
